## Description

EdgeEver Web Clipper saves the current webpage, selected text, or a right-clicked image directly to the self-hosted EdgeEver instance you configure.

- Extract readable article content or preserve the current selection.
- Right-click an image and save that image file as a new note.
- On X, right-click a post and save its visible text and photos as one note.
- Convert captured HTML to Markdown locally.
- Choose a default EdgeEver notebook.
- Send content directly to your instance without an EdgeEver-operated relay.
- No advertising, analytics, tracking, or telemetry.

Before using the extension, enter your EdgeEver instance URL and API token in the extension settings. The extension reads and sends page content only after you click **Clip current page**, **Save image to EdgeEver**, or **Save this post to EdgeEver**.

## Data collection and transmission

- `authenticationInfo`: the API token is sent only to the EdgeEver instance configured by the user.
- `browsingActivity`: the current page URL is included in the note created by the user.
- `websiteContent`: the selected text, extracted article body, or image file is included in the note created by the user.

The project maintainers do not receive or retain this data. Instance settings are stored in the browser's local extension storage.

## Reviewer notes

1. Open the extension settings.
2. Enter the provided review EdgeEver instance URL and API token.
3. Choose **Test connection**, select a notebook, and save.
4. Open a normal HTTP or HTTPS webpage.
5. Open the extension, choose **Clip current page**, and verify that the success message appears.
6. On a normal webpage, right-click an image, choose **Save image to EdgeEver**, and verify the new note contains the image.
7. Open one X post page, right-click the post, choose **Save this post to EdgeEver**, and verify the note contains the visible text and the post link.
8. Verify the created notes in the review EdgeEver instance.

Restricted browser pages, extension stores, built-in PDF viewers, and other privileged pages cannot be captured.
